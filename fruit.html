<p>Fruits are a good source of vitamins and minerals, recognized for their role in preventing vitamin C and vitamin A deficiencies. People who incorporate fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy eating pattern have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. USDA's MyPlate encourages filling half of the plate with fruits and vegetables at mealtimes.
Fruits are an important part of a healthy eating pattern and the source of many vital nutrients, including potassium, folate (folic acid), and antioxidants including polyphenols. Fruit such as blueberries, cranberries, strawberries and citrus also contain phytochemicals that are being studied for their added health benefits.</p>
