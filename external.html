CSS selectors are used to find(or select) the HTML elements you want to style. We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:<br>

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class) Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)<br>

Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)<br>

Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)<br> Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)<br>

<p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique

Element! To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element..</p>

<div class="center">The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.</div>
